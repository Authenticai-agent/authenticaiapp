# Daily Briefing Generation Logic (Rule-Based, Zero LLM Cost)

## Overview
The daily briefing is generated using **pure rule-based logic** with a comprehensive health knowledge base extracted from 13 scientific documents. **No LLM prompts or API calls** - everything is deterministic and cost-free.

## Generation Process

### 1. RISK ASSESSMENT (Input)
```python
environmental_data = {
    'pm25': float,        # µg/m³
    'ozone': float,       # ppb
    'no2': float,         # ppb
    'humidity': float,    # %
    'temperature': float, # °C
    'pollen_level': float # 0-100
}

user_profile = {
    'age': int,
    'allergies': list,
    'asthma_severity': str,
    'triggers': list
}
```

### 2. RISK CALCULATION
```python
# Weighted risk calculation
pm25_risk = (pm25 / 35) * 40  # Max 40 points
ozone_risk = (ozone / 150) * 30  # Max 30 points
no2_risk = (no2 / 100) * 20  # Max 20 points
humidity_penalty = max(0, humidity - 70) * 0.1
temp_penalty = abs(temperature - 22) * 0.1
pollen_penalty = pollen_level * 0.8

# Combination bonus
if pm25 > 12 AND ozone > 70:
    combination_bonus = 15

total_risk = sum(all_factors)  # 0-100
```

### 3. RISK LEVEL MAPPING
```python
if risk_score < 25:
    risk_level = "Low"
    message = "Perfect conditions for jogging, walking, exercising outside"
elif risk_score < 50:
    risk_level = "Moderate"
    message = "Outdoor activities safe with awareness of body's signals"
elif risk_score < 75:
    risk_level = "High"
    message = "Modify outdoor plans, prioritize respiratory wellness"
else:
    risk_level = "Very High"
    message = "Indoor activities recommended to protect lung health"
```

### 4. PRIMARY RISK DRIVER IDENTIFICATION
```python
# Determine WHAT is causing the risk
risk_factors = []
if pm25 > 25:
    risk_factors.append(('pm25', pm25))
if ozone > 100:
    risk_factors.append(('ozone', ozone))
if pollen_level > 50:
    risk_factors.append(('pollen', pollen_level))
if no2 > 40:
    risk_factors.append(('no2', no2))

primary_risk = risk_factors[0][0] if risk_factors else 'general'
```

### 5. KNOWLEDGE BASE LOOKUP
```python
# Get specific insights from knowledge base
pm25_insight = health_kb.get_pm25_insight(pm25)
# Returns: {
#   'impact': 'Fine particles penetrate deep into lungs',
#   'quantified': 'Each 10 µg/m³ increase linked to 6% higher symptoms',
#   'action': 'Sensitive groups reduce prolonged outdoor exertion'
# }

ozone_insight = health_kb.get_ozone_insight(ozone)
# Returns: {
#   'timing': 'Ozone peaks 2-6 PM, drops 40% by morning',
#   'health_effect': 'Reduces lung function by 10-15% during exercise',
#   'action': 'Avoid outdoor exercise 12-6 PM'
# }

exercise_guide = health_kb.get_exercise_guidance(risk_score)
# Returns: {
#   'duration': '20-30 minutes moderate exercise',
#   'timing': 'Morning exercise (6-9 AM) when pollutants lowest',
#   'route': 'Choose routes away from traffic (cuts PM2.5 exposure 60%)',
#   'medication': 'Pre-medicate 30 min before (reduces symptoms 70%)'
# }

pollen_humidity_insight = health_kb.get_pollen_humidity_insight(pollen, humidity)
# Returns: {
#   'impact': 'Humid air makes pollen grains swell and burst',
#   'quantified': 'Pollen stays airborne 3x longer in humid conditions',
#   'action': 'Close windows 10 AM-6 PM (blocks 60% of indoor pollen)'
# }

no2_insight = health_kb.get_no2_insight(no2)
nutrition_tip = health_kb.get_nutrition_tip(risk_score)
sleep_tip = health_kb.get_sleep_tip(risk_score)
longevity_fact = health_kb.get_longevity_fact()
```

### 6. EXPLANATION GENERATION
```python
# Build data-specific explanation
explanation_parts = []

# Always include current conditions
explanation_parts.append(f"PM2.5 is {pm25:.0f} µg/m³ (safe limit: 35)")

# Add secondary factors
if pollen_level > 50:
    explanation_parts.append("but pollen is high")
if humidity > 65 and pollen_level > 30:
    explanation_parts.append(f"and humidity at {humidity:.0f}% makes it more reactive")
if ozone > 100:
    explanation_parts.append(f"ozone at {ozone:.0f} ppb peaks in afternoon")

# Add health impact based on conditions
if pm25 > 35 and ozone > 100:
    impact = "This combo can reduce lung function by 15-20% within 2 hours"
elif ozone > 100:
    impact = "Ozone irritates airways most during afternoon peak (2-5 PM)"
elif pollen_level > 60 and humidity > 65:
    impact = "Sticky pollen in humid air clings to airways 3x longer"
else:
    impact = "These conditions may cause mild symptoms in sensitive individuals"

explanation = ", ".join(explanation_parts) + ". " + impact
```

### 7. ACTION PLAN GENERATION
```python
action_plan = []

# Based on PRIMARY risk driver + risk level
if risk_score < 25:
    # Low risk - encourage outdoor
    action_plan.append("🏃 Perfect for 45-60 min outdoor run or cycling")

        action_plan.append("😷 Pre-medicate 30 min before exercise (reduces symptoms 70%)")
        action_plan.append("⏱️ 20-30 min moderate exercise, monitor symptoms")
    
    elif primary_risk == 'pollen':
        action_plan.append("🌸 High pollen in humid air - more allergens released")
        action_plan.append("🪟 Close windows 10 AM-6 PM (blocks 60% pollen)")
        action_plan.append("🕐 Exercise early morning (6-8 AM) when pollen lowest")
    
    else:
        action_plan.append("🌅 Best times: 6-9 AM or 7-9 PM (cooler, cleaner air)")
        action_plan.append("🏃 20-30 min moderate exercise safe")
        action_plan.append("📱 Use 'talk test' - if can't speak comfortably, slow down")

elif risk_score < 75:
    # High risk - limit outdoor
    if pm25 > 35:
        action_plan.append(f"🏠 Indoor cardio today - PM2.5 at {pm25:.0f} inflames airways in 30 min")
        action_plan.append("😷 N95 mask for errands (blocks 95% of particles)")
        action_plan.append("💨 Run air purifier on high - reduces indoor PM2.5 by 80%")
    else:

    action_plan.append("💨 Air purifier essential - keeps indoor air 5x cleaner")
    action_plan.append("💊 Pre-medicate even for indoor day")
```

### 8. WELLNESS TIPS (NEW!)
```python
wellness_tips = []

# Add nutrition tip based on risk
if risk_score > 50:
    wellness_tips.append("🥗 High antioxidant diet reduces pollution-related inflammation 35%")
elif risk_score > 30:
    wellness_tips.append("🐟 Regular omega-3 intake cuts asthma symptoms 25%")

# Add sleep tip
if risk_score > 40:

# Add longevity fact for motivation
if risk_score < 50:
    wellness_tips.append("💚 Living in areas with PM2.5 < 12 µg/m³ adds 2-3 years life expectancy")
```

### 9. FINAL BRIEFING ASSEMBLY
```python
briefing = f"{risk_intro}\n"
briefing += f"{explanation}\n\n"
briefing += "Your action plan:\n"
for action in action_plan:
    briefing += f"{action}.\n"

# Add wellness tips (limit to 2 for conciseness)
if wellness_tips:
    briefing += "\nWellness boost:\n"
    for tip in wellness_tips[:2]:
        briefing += f"{tip}.\n"

# Scientifically accurate closing (NO PREDICTIONS - data-based only)
if risk_score < 25:
    briefing += "\n✨ Excellent conditions today - make the most of this clean air!"
elif risk_score < 50:
    briefing += "\n💪 Moderate risk is manageable with the right precautions above."
elif risk_score < 75:
    briefing += "\n🛡️ High risk requires caution - follow the action plan to protect your lungs."
else:
    briefing += "\n🚨 Very high risk - indoor activities are safest today."
```

## Example Output

### Scenario 1: Moderate Risk (Score 48), Ozone Primary Driver
```
Today's breathing risk is Moderate at 48/100.
PM2.5 is 12 µg/m³ (below safe 35), ozone at 120 ppb peaks in afternoon. Ozone irritates airways most during afternoon peak (2-5 PM).

Your action plan:
⏰ Exercise 6-9 AM (ozone 120 ppb drops 40% by morning).
🚫 Avoid 2-6 PM when ozone peaks - can trigger coughing/chest pain.
🚶 If afternoon walk needed: stay in shade, reduces ozone exposure 25%.

Wellness boost:
🐟 Regular omega-3 intake cuts asthma symptoms 25%.
💚 Living in areas with PM2.5 < 12 µg/m³ adds 2-3 years life expectancy.

💪 Moderate risk is manageable with the right precautions above.
```

### Scenario 2: High Risk (Score 65), PM2.5 Primary Driver
```
Today's breathing risk is High at 65/100.
PM2.5 is 42 µg/m³ (above safe 35), and humidity at 68% makes it more reactive. At this level, fine particles penetrate deep into airways, triggering inflammation.

Your action plan:
🏠 Indoor cardio today - PM2.5 at 42 can inflame airways in 30 min.
😷 N95 mask for errands (blocks 95% of particles).
💨 Run air purifier on high - reduces indoor PM2.5 by 80%.

Wellness boost:
🥗 High antioxidant diet reduces pollution-related inflammation 35%.
😴 Sleep <7 hours weakens immune response to pollutants by 40%.

🛡️ High risk requires caution - follow the action plan to protect your lungs.
