## 🌍 **LOCATION-AWARE EXAMPLES**

### **Delhi, India** (Extreme Pollution)
```
Risk: 95/100 (Very High)
PM2.5: 56 μg/m³ (WHO safe <15)

Briefing:
🏠 STAY INDOORS — PM2.5 at this level can inflame airways in 30 minutes
😷 N95 mask essential for any outdoor errands (blocks 95% of particles)
💨 Run air purifier on high — reduces indoor PM2.5 by 80%
```

### **Los Angeles** (Ozone Problem)
```
Risk: 58/100 (Moderate)
Ozone: 112 ppb (WHO safe <50)

Briefing:
⏰ Exercise 6-9 AM when ozone drops 40% below afternoon levels
🚫 Avoid outdoor activity 12-6 PM (ozone peak causes 3x more symptoms)
🌳 If afternoon needed: stay in shade, reduces exposure 25%
```

### **Rural Montana** (Clean Air)
```
Risk: 22/100 (Low)
PM2.5: 8 μg/m³ (excellent)

Briefing:
🏃 Perfect for 45-60 min outdoor exercise — air is clean!
🌳 Parks with trees filter PM2.5 by 30-50% vs. streets
💪 Build cardio endurance while conditions are optimal
```

## ⏰ **TIME-SPECIFIC BRIEFINGS**

### **Morning (7 AM)** - Full Day Planning
```
Good morning, Alex! ⚠️ Today's breathing risk is MODERATE (58/100).

🌅 Morning Planning Tip:
Plan indoor activities for today. Check conditions again at noon.
```

### **Midday (12 PM)** - Afternoon Update
```
Midday Update, Alex! 🌤️

⚠️ Ozone is building up (112 ppb). Peak expected 2-6 PM.
Recommendation: Postpone outdoor activities until after 7 PM.

Evening forecast: Check back at 6 PM for tomorrow's outlook.
```

### **Evening (7 PM)** - Reflection + Preview
```
Evening Reflection, Alex! 🌙
