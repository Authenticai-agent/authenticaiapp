## 🔄 **HOW IT WORKS**

### **Daily Variation System:**
```python
# Each day, users get 3 random wellness tips from 300+ options
wellness_boost = wellness_variations.get_wellness_boost(risk_level, user_profile)

# Each day, users get 3 random action plans from 300+ options
action_plan = action_variations.get_action_plan(primary_risk, environmental_data, user_profile)
```

### **Randomization:**
- Uses Python's `random.sample()` to select unique tips
- Different combinations every time
- No repeats within same briefing
- Truly dynamic content
