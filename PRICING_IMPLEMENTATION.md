## ðŸŽ¨ **CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS**

/>
```

2. **Change Contribution Levels:**

const getContributionLevel = (amount: number) => {
  if (amount === 0) return { name: 'Free User', ... };
  if (amount < 10) return { name: 'Supporter', ... };
  if (amount < 20) return { name: 'Contributor', ... };
  // Add more levels
};
```

3. **Modify Annual Discount:**
```tsx
const annualSavings = Math.round(annualAmount * 0.20); // 20% discount
```
