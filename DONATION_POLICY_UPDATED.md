# ✅ Donation Policy Updated!

**Date:** October 4, 2025, 11:21 PM EST  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🎯 **KEY CHANGE**

### **Clarified: Donations Are 100% Voluntary**

Users have **full access** to the app whether they donate or not. Donations are purely to support development and do not affect access.

---

## 📝 **UPDATED DONATION POLICY**

### **New Policy (Clear & Transparent):**

1. ✅ **Donations are 100% voluntary** - you have full access whether you donate or not
2. ✅ **All donations are non-refundable**
3. ✅ **Recurring donations** are charged annually ($10, $20, or $35/year)
4. ✅ **You can cancel anytime** - no access will be lost
5. ✅ **After canceling**, you will not be charged again
6. ✅ **Your donations** help us build and improve the app for everyone

---

## 🔄 **OLD vs NEW**

### **Before (Confusing):**
```
• You can stop recurring donations anytime - you'll retain access 
  until the end of your current period
```
**Problem:** Implied access would be lost after period ends

### **After (Clear):**
```
• Donations are 100% voluntary - you have full access whether 
  you donate or not
• You can cancel recurring donations anytime - no access will be lost
```
**Solution:** Makes it crystal clear donations don't affect access
