# 🗄️ **CUSTOM USERS TABLE MANAGEMENT**

## 📋 **Understanding Your Setup**

You have:
- ✅ **Custom `users` table** in your database (with actual user data)
- ❌ **Supabase Auth `auth.users` table** (empty - authentication not configured)

This means you're using a custom authentication system, not Supabase Auth.

## 🎯 **MANAGING YOUR CUSTOM USERS TABLE**

### **📊 Method 1: View Users in Supabase Dashboard**

1. **Go to**: [https://app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
2. **Navigate to**: `Table Editor` (not Authentication)
3. **Select**: `users` table (not `auth.users`)
4. **View**: All your custom users with data

### **🗑️ Method 2: Delete Users via SQL Editor**

1. **Go to**: Supabase Dashboard → `SQL Editor`
2. **Run queries**:

```sql
-- View all users
SELECT * FROM users;

-- Delete specific user by ID
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 'user-id-here';

-- Delete user by email
DELETE FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';

-- Delete multiple users
DELETE FROM users WHERE id IN ('user1', 'user2', 'user3');

-- Soft delete (mark as inactive instead of deleting)
UPDATE users SET active = false WHERE email = 'user@example.com';

-- Delete users older than 30 days
DELETE FROM users WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days' AND verified = false;
```

### **🔧 Method 3: Custom Admin Endpoints**
