---

## üéØ **CORE FEATURES IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Dynamic Briefing Engine** (`backend/services/dynamic_daily_briefing_engine.py`)

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Real-time Risk Calculation**: Calculates comprehensive risk scores (0-100) using WHO/EPA/CDC thresholds
- **Scientific Explanation Builder**: Pulls insights from health knowledge base with quantified impacts
- **Primary Risk Detection**: Identifies the leading environmental threat (PM2.5, ozone, pollen, NO‚ÇÇ)
- **Personalized Action Plans**: Adapts recommendations based on:
  - Primary risk driver
  - User's asthma severity and triggers
  - Fitness goals and lifestyle
  - Current environmental conditions
- **Wellness Integration**: Nutrition, sleep, and longevity tips tailored to preferences

**Scientific Thresholds Integrated:**
```python
PM2.5:
- WHO Safe: <15 Œºg/m¬≥
- EPA Moderate: 35 Œºg/m¬≥
- EPA Unhealthy: 55 Œºg/m¬≥

Ozone:
- WHO Safe: <50 ppb
- EPA Moderate: 100 ppb
- EPA Unhealthy: 150 ppb

NO‚ÇÇ:
- WHO Safe: <25 ppb
- EPA Moderate: 50 ppb
- EPA Unhealthy: 100 ppb
```

**Synergistic Effects:**
- Multi-pollutant amplification (PM2.5 + Ozone = +15 risk points)
- Humidity-pollen interactions (3x longer airborne at >65% humidity)
- Weather amplification factors

---

### **2. API Endpoints** (`backend/routers/daily_briefing.py`)

#### **Public Endpoint:**
```
GET /api/v1/daily-briefing/dynamic-briefing?lat={lat}&lon={lon}
```
- No authentication required
- Uses test user profile (Alex, 34, moderate asthma)
- Returns briefing + metadata + environmental summary

#### **Authenticated Endpoint:**
```
GET /api/v1/daily-briefing/dynamic-briefing-authenticated
```
- Requires authentication
- Uses actual user profile from database
- Personalized to user's triggers, goals, preferences

**Response Structure:**
```json

## üî¨ **EXAMPLE BRIEFINGS**

### **Example 1: Hot Day with Ozone Spike**
```
Good morning, Alex! ‚ö†Ô∏è Today's breathing risk is MODERATE (58/100) for your moderate asthma.

Ozone is 112 ppb (WHO safe <50). Can reduce lung function 10-15% during exercise. | Pollen index 68/100 with 72% humidity. Pollen stays airborne 3x longer in humid conditions.

Your action plan:
‚è∞ Exercise 6-9 AM when ozone drops 40% below afternoon levels.
üö´ Avoid outdoor activity 12-6 PM (ozone peak causes 3x more symptoms).
üå≥ If afternoon needed: stay in shade, reduces exposure 25%.

Wellness boost:
ü•ó Extra antioxidants today (berries, leafy greens) ‚Äî reduces pollution-related inflammation by 35%.
üò¥ Prioritize 7-8h sleep tonight ‚Äî poor rest weakens immune response to pollutants by 40%.

Stay resilient, Alex ‚Äî today's environment is unique, but so is your strategy. üí™
```

### **Example 2: Rain + PM2.5 Spike from Traffic**
```
Good morning, Alex! üö® Today's breathing risk is HIGH (72/100) for your moderate asthma.

PM2.5 is 38 ¬µg/m¬≥ (WHO safe <15). Particles cause airway inflammation within 30-60 minutes. | NO‚ÇÇ is 65 ppb from traffic. Living near busy roads increases asthma risk by 25%.

Your action plan:
üè† Indoor cardio today - PM2.5 at 38 can inflame airways in 30 min.
üò∑ N95 mask for errands (blocks 95% of particles).
üí® Run air purifier on high ‚Äî reduces indoor PM2.5 by 80%.

Wellness boost:
ü•ó Extra antioxidants today (berries, leafy greens) ‚Äî reduces pollution-related inflammation by 35%.
üíß Stay hydrated (8-10 glasses) ‚Äî helps mucus membranes trap and clear pollutants.

Stay resilient, Alex ‚Äî today's environment is unique, but so is your strategy. üí™
```

### **Example 3: Excellent Air Quality Day**
```
Good morning, Alex! ‚òÄÔ∏è Today's breathing risk is LOW (18/100) for your moderate asthma.

PM2.5 is 8 ¬µg/m¬≥ (excellent). Great day for outdoor exercise and deep breathing!

Your action plan:
üèÉ Perfect for 45-60 min outdoor exercise ‚Äî air is clean!
üå≥ Parks with trees filter PM2.5 by 30-50% vs. streets.
üí™ Build cardio endurance while conditions are optimal.

Wellness boost:
üõèÔ∏è Run air purifier in bedroom ‚Äî improves sleep quality by 25%.
üíö Living in areas with PM2.5 < 12 ¬µg/m¬≥ adds 2-3 years life expectancy.

Stay resilient, Alex ‚Äî today's environment is unique, but so is your strategy. üí™
```
